[2017-09-26 16:09:26.927] [jointLog] [info] Computed 3728 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-09-26 16:09:26.927] [jointLog] [info] Counted 45805 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-09-26 16:09:26.962] [jointLog] [warning] Only 45805 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
